## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the stock prices of the **top 30 companies in the Egyptian stock market (EGX30)** until **2027** using a robust machine learning model. Our approach achieves an **R² score of 99%**, ensuring high accuracy in stock price forecasts.

## 🔬 Methodology
The model utilizes a **complex blending** approach, combining:
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) - 80% weight**
- **Voting Ensemble (20% weight) consisting of:**
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Linear Regression

This weighted blending technique enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging the strengths of both deep learning and traditional machine learning models.

## 📊 Current Development Status
🚧 **This project is still under development.** Predictions are currently based on existing data, and refinements are ongoing to improve generalization and real-world applicability.

## 🏗 Future Plans
- **Fine-tuning hyperparameters** for improved performance
- **Exploring additional feature engineering techniques**
- **Adding real-time stock market data integration**
